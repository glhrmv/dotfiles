# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I'll have an install script here, eventually. 
I'm not very good at this yet.

## homebrew

To install the formulae in the `Brewfile`, run `brew bundle install`. 
Use `brew bundle dump` to dump installed formulae into a `Brewfile`.

## vim

The `.vimrc` file should automatically download 
[`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/) 
and install the listed plugins.
